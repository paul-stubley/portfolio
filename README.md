 To hold the code covering my DS portfolio

# TODO
- [x] Disaster response image fits wrong on Github, works fine locally
- [x] Background color (e.g. for NYC map) is grey on Github, is white locally
- [x] Min height for NYC map (e.g for mobile viewing)
- [x] Max height for package image (for mobile)
- [ ] Gradient descent heatmap animations (with draw your own boundary?)
- [ ] Set max width of entire page so it doesn't spread so much on fullscreen?
